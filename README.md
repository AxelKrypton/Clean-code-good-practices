# Good practices in general programming

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

These two presentations try to explore generic good practices in coding giving advice that should be in great part independent of the programming language.
In the [releases page](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/Clean-code-good-practices/releases) you can find all versions of the talks as PDF file, while clicking on the book and floppy disk icons only the last version is accessible.

## Clean code

This presentation has been prepared based on the «Clean code» book by Robert C. Martin, also known as uncle Bob.
It was originally given in a C++ user group meeting and, therefore, the code examples are in C++, but the abstract ideas are totally independent from the programming language.

## Clean testing

After having presented the Clean Code part I got asked for a follow up about testing.
I gave it a try, collecting several ideas around in books and on the web.
It turned out to be more challenging than expected, so I do not guarantee to have succeded. :innocent:
Most of the material I used to prepare this presentation is mentioned in the talk itself (cf. slide about different types of tests).
To stay consistent with the previous presentation, I continued using C++ as programming language for examples, but, once again, the advice should go way beyond the specific language.

## Note about LaTeX compilation

If you wish to compile LaTeX source code, the `TeXnicalities` package and the used beamer theme are needed and can be found [here](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/TeXnicalities).
