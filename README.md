# Clean code good practices

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This presentation has been prepared based on the «Clean code» book by Robert C. Martin, also known as uncle Bob.
It was originally given in a C++ user group meeting and, therefore, the code examples are in C++, but the abstract ideas are totally independent from the programming language.


## Note about LaTeX compilation

If you wish to compile LaTeX source code, the `TeXnicalities` package and the used beamer theme are needed and can be found [here](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/TeXnicalities).
